Let me show you the door. The gateway through which we will enter into this Christ-centered spirituality is through *meditation upon the life of Jesus Christ*. Immerse yourself in the sacred mysteries of Christ. Step into the ancient world laid out line-by-line in the pages of the gospels. Explore its timeworn terrain. Enlist your intelligence and your imagination. Allow yourself to feel with your feelings and reason with your reasoning. Use every faculty at your disposal to search out and learn from the Master of Life. But beware! When you wander the trackless wasteland with the wandering Teacher, you run the risk of transformation. Prepare to have your preconceptions pummeled, your cherished ideas challenged and stretched, and your lifestyle questioned and changed. Try not to resist the sweeping force of this enigmatic stranger as he woos and whispers and draws you to himself. Unless your soul falls so madly in love with the person of Jesus Christ that nothing else holds the same fascination to your mind and affections, the practice of spirituality will be dull and lifeless religion rather than the raging love affair it was intended to be. Let the following pages kindle the spark of fleeting hope into a roaring flame of soul-intoxication with the consuming reality of Christ.

Who was Jesus, really? What kind of person was he? What images are summoned to mind when you hear his name? Can we *love* whom we do not *know*? Crucial to the practice of Christ-centered spirituality is a first-hand rediscovery of the forgotten figure of Jesus recorded in the eyewitness accounts of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. As we become familiar with that old, old story of stories, we watch in wonder as he treads upon all our cherished assumptions.

This is your initiation into the Mystery: Why do we use the term "mystery" more than truth? A truth is a successful attempt to know and describe actual reality. A mystery is a reality about which what we don't know far outweighs what we do know. So, while we are discussing truth, the term "mystery" is also quite appropriate:

By all credible accounts, Jesus of Nazareth was and is a radical paradox; a wondrous contradiction of such rich texture and beauty that he is impossible to ignore. Like finely cut crystal, he has many facets, some of which seem diametrically opposed to one another. To use Nicholas of Cusa's phrase, he is a holy man; a coincidence of opposites. He is a lion suggestive of a lamb. He is a rebel against society, a simple carpenter, an apocalyptic prophet, a critic of religion, a faithful friend, a miracle worker, a failure who changed the world. He is a teacher, a learner, a servant, a master, a soul physician, a martyr, a revolutionary, a peacemaker with a sword, dangerous, compassionate, wild, gentle, tenacious, unpredictable, burdened with sorrows, soaring with joy, and utterly without fear. Let his life speak for itself without trying to fit him neatly into a box.

Most attempts to explain Jesus have ended with a domesticated caricature that strangely resembles the author's own biases, ideals, and culture (a danger to which this book also is not exempt). The marginalized of his day were drawn magnetically towards him while self-righteous religious leaders were repelled by this same dynamic force. He touched lepers, overturned temple furniture, angered the religious establishment, frightened military and government leaders, and chatted with children. He was down-to-earth and larger-than-life, immanent and transcendent, the ideal picture of both strength and submission, of peace and passion, of confidence and humility, of man and God.

One thing cannot be denied: he had an unbridled intensity for the liberation of the human race. He was arrested, scourged, and crucified because he posed a significant threat to the existing power brokers of the world system. The notion that he was just a "nice, decent man" who told others to become "nice, decent men" is simply an uninformed fiction. Burning within his chest was a revolutionary agenda for global transformation. He had a plan to undermine and overturn society by freeing individual hearts, a plan still going strong to this day- Jesus alone brings realistic hope for confronting head-on the core complications of our desperate human condition: Like the Greek legend of Prometheus, Christ descended from the heavens bearing within himself the torch of living flame that gives light to all humankind. Yet this is revolution born in the very heart of God himself. Imagine the Creator inciting an uprising among his own creatures. He offers illumination to all who do not love darkness more than light: blinding brilliance of Jesus: invite you now: lift the eyes of your heart and look upon the Through tracing out the luminous lines of his birth, life, teachings, death, and resurrection, You will sketch the schematic drawings for the original prototype of humanity. You will also catch a fleeting glimpse of the unseen face of God. Gaze upon the illumined face of Christ as a mirror and window: through which you can truly know thyself and also find enfleshed in him the invisible visage of the unseen God. The ultimate truth about God and man is revealed in the person of Jesus Christ.

## MEDITATION EXERCISES

One of the best ways of connecting with God is through the free flight of the imagination guided and anchored by the sacred Scriptures subjective experience grounded upon objective revelation. Try the following meditation exercise: (Note: In all the meditations in this book; take your time. If any point particularly resonates within you; just remain quietly reflecting upon it until your soul feels satisfied that you have received all that you were seeking. You are in no hurry.)

**Preparation:** Sit up straight, close your eyes and spend a minute in silence.

**Scripture:** Now slowly read Jesus' statement from John 8.12: 

**"I am / the light / of the world. / Whoever / follows me / will never / walk in darkness, / but will have / the light / of life."**

1. Re-read it, pausing for at least 5 seconds at every slash mark. During each pause, try to savor its meaning as fully as you can. Exercise your mind using pictures, definitions, synonyms, questions, associations, feelings, prayers ... or just breathe: Slowly re-read the verse again and again until you feel you have extracted all that the Spirit of the Living God wants to communicate to you today through this simple sentence: What comes to mind?

2. Imagine Jesus' dusty, sandaled feet walking, walking, walking along the windswept landscape of the Judean hillside. Do not try to imagine his face or body, just his feet and ankles up to the hem of his garment. Close your eyes and spend a minute watching his dirt-stained, rugged feet making their way along the rocky path. 

3. What is his pace - fast or slow? Where are his feet taking him? Who or what does he encounter along the way?

**Response:** Now imagine carrying on face-to-face conversation with Jesus: (In doing this, your imagination may be more true to reality than your eyes.) Ask him if you can follow him: What do you think he would say to you? Conclude by asking to see him as he truly is. Ask him to clear up any confusion you may have about him. Spend a minute quietly resting in his Presence. Write in your journal any insights, reactions, questions, observations, or prayers from this exercise:
